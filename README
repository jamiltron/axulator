# axulator

Axulator is a simple little utility to evaluate battles for the game Axis & Allies.  It helps players of the game evaluate the odds of winning a particular battle between forces by simulating the battle and providing basic statistics on the outcome.

## Usage

At this point, you can evaluate the number of hits for an attacking or defending force by:

  (force-hits :attack [[5 :infantry] [10 :armor] [2 :fighter]] (d6))

  (force-hits :defned [[20 :infantry] [2 :armor]] (d6))

As it is developed further, it will iterate over a particular battle and provide stats to help
assess the probability of either side winning.
